Create a program to perform the following operations :
That is to say a class of 5 students: 
John, 24 (const john = 24;)
Barbara, 28 years old (const barbara = 28;) etc...
Patrick, 32 years old
Benjamin, 17 years old
Sylvie, 36 years old
Calculate the sum of the ages 
Calculate the average age
Calculate the age difference between the youngest and oldest student
Show "true" or "false": the age difference is more than 10 years
Show "true" or "false": John and Benjamin are under 25 years old
Create a variable using the ternary operator which will have the following value : 
If Sylvie's under 35: "There's no one over 35."
If Sylvie's over 35: "At least one person is over 35."


// solutions

//sum age
const john = 24;
const barbara = 28;
const patrick = 32;
const benjamin = 17;
const sylvie = 36; 

console.log(john+barbara+patrick+benjamin+sylvie);


//average age

console.log((john+barbara+patrick+benjamin+sylvie)/5);

//diff oldest and youngest
console.log(sylvie - benjamin)

//true or false if age diff is more than 10 years

const ageDiff = 19
let i = (ageDiff > 10)  ? console.log("true") : console.log("false")


//Show "true" or "false": John and Benjamin are under 25 years old

let j = (john < 25) && (benjamin < 25) ? console.log("true") : console.log("false")

// Create a variable using the ternary operator which will have the following value : 
//If Sylvie's under 35: "There's no one over 35."
//If Sylvie's over 35: "At least one person is over 35."

let z = (sylvie < 35) ? console.log("There's no one over 35.") : console.log("At least one person is over 35.")
