Create a program to perform the following operations :
That is to say a class of 5 students: 
John, 24 (const john = 24;)
Barbara, 28 years old (const barbara = 28;) etc...
Patrick, 32 years old
Benjamin, 17 years old
Sylvie, 36 years old
Calculate the sum of the ages 
Calculate the average age
Calculate the age difference between the youngest and oldest student
Show "true" or "false": the age difference is more than 10 years
Show "true" or "false": John and Benjamin are under 25 years old
Create a variable using the ternary operator which will have the following value : 
If Sylvie's under 35: "There's no one over 35."
If Sylvie's over 35: "At least one person is over 35."


// solutions

//sum age
const john = 24;
const barbara = 28;
const patrick = 32;
const benjamin = 17;
const sylvie = 36; 

console.log(john+barbara+patrick+benjamin+sylvie);


//average age

console.log((john+barbara+patrick+benjamin+sylvie)/5);

//diff oldest and youngest
console.log(sylvie - benjamin)

//true or false if age diff is more than 10 years

const ageDiff = 19
let i = (ageDiff > 10)  ? console.log("true") : console.log("false")


//Show "true" or "false": John and Benjamin are under 25 years old

let j = (john < 25) && (benjamin < 25) ? console.log("true") : console.log("false")

// Create a variable using the ternary operator which will have the following value : 
//If Sylvie's under 35: "There's no one over 35."
//If Sylvie's over 35: "At least one person is over 35."

let z = (sylvie < 35) ? console.log("There's no one over 35.") : console.log("At least one person is over 35.")


//other way to do


let ageArray = [24,28,32,17,36]

const john = ageArray[0];
const barbara = ageArray[1];
const patrick = ageArray[2];
const benjamin = ageArray[3];
const sylvie = ageArray[4];


const totalAge = (john + barbara + patrick + benjamin + sylvie);
console.log(totalAge);

console.log(totalAge/ageArray.length);

//

//total age
const totalAge2 = () => ageArray[0] + ageArray[1] + ageArray[2] + ageArray[3] + ageArray[4]

let sumOfAge = ageArray.reduce(totalAge2)
console.log(sumOfAge);

//moyenne d'age
const averageAge = () => (sumOfAge) / ageArray.length
console.log(averageAge(ageArray))

// 

const oldest = Math.max(john, barbara, patrick, benjamin, sylvie);
const youngest = Math.min(john, barbara, patrick, benjamin, sylvie);

const difference = oldest - youngest;


const diff = () => {
  const difference = oldest - youngest;
  console.log(difference)
}


console.log(diff())

let max = Math.max(...ageArray);
let min = Math.min(...ageArray);
console.log('Difference between older and youngest', max - min);

// 

let differenceAge2 = (difference > 10) ? true : false
console.log(differenceAge2)

let differenceAge3 = (john && benjamin < 25) ? true : false
console.log(differenceAge3)

let elder = (sylvie < 35) ? "There's no over 35." : "At least one person is over 35."
console.log(elder)
